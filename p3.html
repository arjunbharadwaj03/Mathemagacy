                        Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao, commonly known as C.R. Rao,
                        born on September 10, 1920, in India, is a distinguished
                        Indian-American statistician and mathematician. After
                        completing his education in India and England, Rao
                        embarked on a prolific career that spanned several
                        continents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rao's seminal contributions to the field of statistics
                        have left an indelible mark. His work on multivariate
                        statistical analysis, experimental design, and
                        information theory has significantly advanced the
                        understanding and application of statistical methods.
                        One of his most notable contributions is the Cramér–Rao
                        inequality, a fundamental result in the theory of
                        estimation. He also introduced the concept of
                        Rao–Blackwellization, a technique to improve statistical
                        estimators.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout his career, Rao held positions at esteemed
                        institutions such as the Indian Statistical Institute,
                        Cambridge University, and the University of Pittsburgh.
                        He played a pivotal role in shaping statistical
                        education and research globally. His dedication to
                        statistical science was recognized with numerous honors
                        and awards, including the National Medal of Science in
                        the United States.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even in his later years, Rao remained active, publishing
                        research and contributing to the advancement of
                        statistical methodology. His legacy continues to
                        influence generations of statisticians, and he is
                        celebrated as one of the preeminent figures in the
                        history of statistics.
