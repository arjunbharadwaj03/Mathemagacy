                        Aryabhata, a brilliant Indian mathematician and
                        astronomer, made profound contributions to the field
                        during the 5th century. His most notable achievement was
                        the introduction of zero, revolutionizing numerical
                        systems. Aryabhata's work extended to the decimal
                        system, providing a robust foundation for arithmetic
                        operations. His groundbreaking treatise, Aryabhatiya,
                        delved into algebra, trigonometry, and spherical
                        geometry.

                    <p>
                        Aryabhata's astronomical prowess was equally remarkable.
                        He accurately calculated the value of Ï€ (pi) and
                        described the Earth's rotation on its axis, centuries
                        before these concepts gained wider recognition. The
                        Arya-siddhanta, his astronomical treatise, outlined
                        planetary motions and solar and lunar eclipses.

                    <p>
                        His influence on Indian mathematics endured, shaping
                        subsequent developments in the subcontinent and
                        influencing Islamic and medieval European scholars.
                        Aryabhata's legacy lies not only in numerical
                        innovations but also in fostering a spirit of inquiry
                        that continues to inspire mathematicians and astronomers
                        worldwide, making him a cornerstone figure in the
                        history of Indian mathematics.
